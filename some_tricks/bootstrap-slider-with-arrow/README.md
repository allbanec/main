# Bootstrap Slider with arrow
## Styled Bootstrap Slider with scroller and arrow

 The task is: to make a styled bootstrap tabs with slider, arrow and tab-navigation....

 I used:
  [Bootstrap Tabs](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tabs)
  [Bootstrap Carousel](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel)
  [Bootstrap Thumbnails](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#thumbnails)
  [Bootstrap Grid](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid)

 Thank You for all!

 There is not enough to close my task use standard plugins and options...

 I need to change the styles and to combine all of them in one plugin...

 OK!

 I use SCSS for my style. But you can see CSS file only if you need.

 I blocked(some classes) standard Bootstrap CSS and change it in my SCSS file...

 DONE!

 You can see the working version in index.php file.

 Now this calculator located in some ours landing pages.

 Be sure it is responsive... i tested: IPAD(vertical and horizontal), Smartphone ... Galaxy III(horizontal)... vertical is to small to show all our options... sorry!

 Look`s same like this:
