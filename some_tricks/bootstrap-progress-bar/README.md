## Progress Bar
In our project sometimes we use progress bars.

Every time are different.

Let`s do it!

I will update this repo sometimes... follow it!

1. 1_version -  it was progress bar for WinWinSignals Landing Page

For this progress bar i used standard [Bootstrap Progress Bar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#progress).

I made some CSS tricks and you can see cool progress bar now...
