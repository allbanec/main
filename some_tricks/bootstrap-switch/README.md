## Styled Bootstrap Switch

 The task is: to make a styled switch for one interface....

 I used [Bootstrap Switch 3.3.2](https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch)

 Thank You for owner!

 Bootstrap Switch work`s good! Realy good...

 But it was not enough to close my task...

 I need to change the style...

 OK!

 I use SASS for my style. But you can see CSS file only if you need.

 I blocked standard Bootstrap Switch CSS and change it in my SCSS file and put inside two new blocks with ON and OFF labels...

 If the switch is on, one of the labels toggle`s them class "active"(use simple Jquery) and styles are change`s...

 DONE!

 You can see the working version in index.php file.

 Look`s same like this:
